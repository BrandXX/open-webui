## 📂 Tools

### 🛠️ Overview
This directory contains custom **Tools** designed for use within **Open-WebUI**. Tools are independent utilities callable directly by the LLM, intended to extend functionality, automate tasks, and provide specialized capabilities.

### 📌 Structure
Each tool should have:
- A dedicated folder with the tool's name.
- An individual `README.md` detailing usage, dependencies, and examples.
- Clearly documented input/output schemas.

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the desired tool's directory.
3. Follow individual setup instructions provided.

### 📝 Contribution
To contribute a tool:
- Fork this repository.
- Create a new branch for your tool.
- Submit a pull request with clear documentation.

## 📂 Functions

### ⚙️ Overview
This directory hosts **Functions** intended for internal logic reuse, modularity, and tool chaining within **Open-WebUI**. Functions allow complex logic to be encapsulated into callable units that tools or pipelines can use internally.

### 📌 Structure
Functions should:
- Reside in individual folders named clearly.
- Include comprehensive inline documentation.
- Define clear input parameters and expected outputs.

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import and integrate desired functions into your tools or pipelines.

### 📝 Contribution
To contribute functions:
- Fork and branch from this repo.
- Ensure thorough testing and documentation.
- Open a pull request with examples demonstrating practical integration.

## 📂 Pipelines

### 🔗 Overview
This directory contains **Pipelines**, representing sequences of integrated tools and functions designed for complex workflows within **Open-WebUI**. Pipelines automate multi-step processes and ensure consistency in execution.

### 📌 Structure
Each pipeline should:
- Have a descriptive name clearly representing its functionality.
- Include a detailed `README.md` explaining each step.
- Document dependencies on tools and functions explicitly.

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to your chosen pipeline.
3. Follow pipeline-specific setup instructions in its own README.

### 📝 Contribution
To add new pipelines:
- Fork and branch the repository.
- Clearly document each step and integration.
- Provide use-case examples in your pull request.

## 📂 __llm_instuctions_open-webui

### 📖 Overview
This directory contains resources specifically tailored for **Augment**, a Local Coding LLM running as an extension in VSCode. Augment leverages the contents of this directory for examples, documentation, instructions, and training purposes to improve its code generation and understanding capabilities.

### 📌 Structure
Resources should:
- Be clearly organized into folders based on use-case or context.
- Include examples, detailed explanations, and comprehensive documentation.
- Remain accessible and readable to both humans and Augment.

### 🚀 Usage
- Augment automatically references and utilizes these resources during coding tasks in VSCode.
- Human contributors should ensure materials are clear, concise, and illustrative.

### 📝 Contribution
To contribute resources:
- Fork and branch the repository.
- Clearly label and document each resource.
- Provide meaningful context and examples in your pull request.
