## How It Works

1. **Initiate Scraping:**  
   When you trigger the tool, it sends an asynchronous request to the Crawl4AI server to start scraping your specified URL.

2. **Progress Updates:**  
   The tool emits messages to keep you in the loop:
   - *Start:* Notification that the scraping has begun.
   - *Waiting:* Updates while the tool is processing your request.
   - *Finished:* Confirmation that scraping is complete.
   - *Error:* Clear error messages if something goes awry.

3. **Content Processing:**  
   After scraping, the tool processes the returned markdown, applying your custom filters and link management rules.

4. **Output:**  
   The final, cleaned markdown output is returned for you to use in your projects.
