## 📂 Pipelines

### 🔗 Overview
This directory contains **Pipelines**, representing sequences of integrated tools and functions designed for complex workflows within **Open-WebUI**. Pipelines automate multi-step processes and ensure consistency in execution.

### 📌 Structure
Each pipeline should:
- Have a descriptive name clearly representing its functionality.
- Include a detailed `README.md` explaining each step.
- Document dependencies on tools and functions explicitly.

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to your chosen pipeline.
3. Follow pipeline-specific setup instructions in its own README.

### 📝 Contribution
To add new pipelines:
- Fork and branch the repository.
- Clearly document each step and integration.
- Provide use-case examples in your pull request.
